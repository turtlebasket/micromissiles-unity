## Prerequisites

- A computer with internet access.
- Administrative privileges to install software.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your system (optional, for cloning the repository).

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Unity Hub

Unity Hub is a desktop application that manages your Unity projects and installations. It simplifies the process of installing different Unity versions and launching projects.

**Steps to Install Unity Hub:**

1. Visit the [Unity Download Page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
2. Click on **"Download Unity Hub"**.
3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### 2. Clone the Project Repository

Obtain the project source code by cloning the repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PisterLab/micromissiles-unity.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a preferred location.

### 3. Launch the Project via Unity Hub

1. **Open Unity Hub**.

2. **Add the Project to Unity Hub**:
   - Navigate to the **"Projects"** tab.
   - Click on the **"ADD"** button.
   - Browse to the folder where you cloned or extracted the project.
   - Select the folder containing the `Assets` folder and click on **"Select Folder"**.

3. **Install the Required Unity Version**:
   - Unity Hub will detect if the project requires a Unity version that is not currently installed.
   - A notification or warning icon may appear next to the project name.
   - Click on the notification and select **"Install Unity **[version]**"**.
   - Unity Hub will download and install the required Unity version automatically.

4. **Open the Project**:
   - Once the required Unity version is installed, click on the project name in Unity Hub to open it.

### 4. Open the Main Scene

After the project opens in Unity:

1. In the **Project** window (usually located at the bottom), navigate to:

   ```
   Assets/Scenes/
   ```

2. Find the main scene file, usually named `MainScene.unity`.

3. Double-click on `MainScene.unity` to open it.

4. The scene will load in the **Scene** view. You can now run the simulation by clicking the **Play** button at the top of the Unity Editor.
