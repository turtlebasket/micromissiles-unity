| **Move Right**       | **D** or **Right Arrow**           | Moves the camera to the right side.                       |
| **Move Upward**      | **Q**                               | Raises the camera upward.                                 |
| **Move Downward**    | **E**                               | Lowers the camera downward.                               |

### Camera Speed

Adjust the speed of the camera movement to suit your preference:

| **Action**           | **Keybind**       | **Description**                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Increase Speed**   | **Left Shift (Hold)** | Hold down the Left Shift key to move the camera faster.   |
| **Normal Speed**     | *Release Left Shift*  | Releases the Left Shift key to return to normal movement speed. |

### Simulation Controls

Manage the simulation state with these keybinds:

| **Action**           | **Keybind**       | **Description**                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pause/Resume**     | **Spacebar**      | Toggles between pausing and resuming the simulation.     |
| **Restart Simulation** | **R**           | Restarts the simulation from the beginning.               |
| **Toggle Configuration Panel** | **L** | Opens or closes the configuration selector panel for adjusting simulation settings. |

### Additional Controls

Enhance your interaction with the simulation using these additional keybinds:

| **Action**           | **Keybind**       | **Description**                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| **Quit Application** | **Esc**           | Exits the simulation application.                         |

### Preset Views

Quickly switch to predefined camera angles for different perspectives:

| **Action**           | **Keybind**       | **Description**                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preset View 1**    | **1**             | Switches to the first predefined camera view.             |
| **Preset View 2**    | **2**             | Switches to the second predefined camera view.            |
| **Preset View 3**    | **3**             | Switches to the third predefined camera view.             |
| **Preset View 4**    | **4**             | Switches to the fourth predefined camera view.            |
| **Preset View 5**    | **5**             | Switches to the fifth predefined camera view.             |
| **Preset View 6**    | **6**             | Switches to the sixth predefined camera view.             |

*Note: The implementation for preset views may be added in future updates.*

## Tips for Effective Navigation

- **Combining Controls**: Feel free to combine mouse and keyboard controls for a more dynamic navigation experience. For example, hold the **Left Shift** key while moving the camera forward with the **W** key for faster traversal.
- **Pausing for Adjustments**: Use the **Spacebar** to pause the simulation, allowing you to adjust camera angles or settings without interruption.
- **Exploring Views**: Utilize the preset views to quickly jump to different perspectives, making it easier to explore various aspects of the simulation.

We hope this guide enhances your experience. Happy simming!
